Aggressive compilation optimization flags
Blazingly fast HashMap/Set (discovered through time trials) that are excellent regarding insertion and find
Graph class manipulation really only concerns the node_ids to conserve space and speed up the process
Search starts at source and ends at sink nodes
Did multithreading in the first place for the searches (good approach since it is not modifying the graph in any way)
For the multithreading, instead of using static batches, get them as the searches finish up for a thread
Stores the results of the thread's work into a local vector and merges them all at the end
Used moved semantics for the merge at the end
When processing the graph, reassign the IDs such that they are contiguous, and making a vector useable
Clean up the multithreading
