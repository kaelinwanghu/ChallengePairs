# ChallengePairs
For-fun project that gets a graph of alive people with Wikipedian articles and tries to find the longest shortest path (no cycles) among them, although it can be used to generally find the longest shortest path within any graph.\
Rewritten from the Rose-Hulman CSSE230 "GraphSurfing" project from Java into C++ for faster performance and better multithreading, the project contains both a regular brute-force BFS search (although even that is slightly optimized by only starting at source nodes and ending at sink nodes or when there the search gets into a dead end), as well as an enhanced BFS search that uses a clique collapse heuristic to reduce the size of the graph (good for especially dense graphs)\
For VSCode on Windows, open the ChallengePairs folder up, get a PowerShell terminal, and then do "Ctrl + Shift + B" to compile it with the tasks.json flag and specifications. Then, after the ChallengePairs.exe file shows up in build, do "cd build" and then "./ChallengePairs" to run it\
Currently, it can run a BFS search on a graph of 645047 vertices and 3253698 edges in 2.5 milliseconds (on average) for a Lenovo P1 Gen 6 Thinkpad with a 13th Gen i7-13700H CPU and 16 GB of 5600 MT/S DDR5
